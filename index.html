	<p>Working for Pandora's Box, I published multiple stories covering news, arts & culture. Here are some to take a look at.</p>

<div class="caption"> <p> This is just an image of a gate, but it's a story I'm proud of. I was able to create a small change through writing about a closed school entrance at York that affected the commutes of many students and staff around campus. </p></div>

<p>I worked on a heartfelt story about esential staff working on campus through the pandemic. It was September 2020 and we still had to follow most of the COVID-19 protocols. At this time the newspaper operated solely online. It was difficult to coordinate, but ultimately a great effort.</p>

<p>Arts & culture was a lighter topic I would cover if it was a slow news week. I've done some fun articles on Netflix shows, recipes art exhibits and more. One arts story I'm proud of  was a review I write about Netflix's Grand Army.</p>
